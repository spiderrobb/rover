Question 1: 
Unique Authenticated Home Page Visitors: 2,209
Unique Anonymous Home Page Visitors: 1,893
Q1 Assumptions:
If authenticated person_opk was used to indicate a unique user.
If anonymous distict_id was used to indicate a unique user.

Question 2: Percentage of authenticated users that visit the search page within 30 mins 
of viewing the home page 4.66%
Q2 Assumptions:
Same Assumptions as Q1, Data was ordered by ts in ascending order, each users 
most recent home page ts was recorded, and if there was a following search page 
visit with a ts <= 1800 older than the most recent home page visit it counted 
towards the ratio.

Question 3: Average number of pageviews per user 0.49
Q3 Assumptions: 
Same Assumptions as Q1 for definition of "User".
Metric takes both Authenticated and Anonymous users.
Count the total number of Search Page Views, and divide by number of unique users.

Question 4: Best UTM source for generating users that visit the search page then the home page 9113d19048abb65bbff551b3417301d6
Q4 Assumptions:
First UTM Source found for a user was considered the utm that generated the user.
Counted only users that first visited the home page, then visited the search page.
This metric did not care about the time elapsed between homepage and search pageviews.

Question 5: Information needed to calculate search rates from 2 different versions of the search page.
If a search page view does not imply a user making a search, then we need event data rows 
with a different event_name potentially "search". This would get logged whenever a user 
performs a search request.
As for the version of the search page, this could be stored in a new column 
"page_category_version" and could be added to any locations that the logs are generated. 
Alternatively we could alter the uri_path to reflect the page version.
